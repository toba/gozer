Incomplete implementation in analyzer.go:5416.

The handling for iter.seq (Go iterator types) is incomplete and needs to be continued.

## Checklist
- [ ] Review current iter.seq handling
- [ ] Identify missing functionality
- [ ] Implement remaining iterator type support
- [ ] Add test cases for iterator types
